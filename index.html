  second_thermo: {
    name: "Second Law of Thermodynamics",
    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "\\Delta S_{\\text{universe}} \\geq 0",
    full_explanation: `
## üå°Ô∏è Historical Origin
Formulated in the mid-19th century by Rudolf Clausius and Lord Kelvin, the Second Law states that the **entropy of an isolated system never decreases**. It introduces the thermodynamic arrow of time.

## üìê Formulation and Justification
Entropy $S$ quantifies microscopic disorder. For a reversible process: $dS = \\frac{\\delta Q_{\\text{rev}}}{T}$. In irreversible processes (e.g., gas diffusion), experiments show $\\Delta S > 0$.

Ludwig Boltzmann (1877) gave a statistical proof:  
$$
S = k_B \\ln \\Omega
$$
where $\\Omega$ is the number of microstates. Systems evolve toward the most probable macrostate‚Äîmaximum entropy.

## üß† Key Assumptions
- Validity of statistical mechanics
- Ergodicity (system explores all accessible microstates over time)

## üí• Implications
- Impossibility of a perpetual motion machine of the second kind
- Defines the direction of time (past = low entropy, future = high entropy)
- Explains why the early universe had extremely low entropy (cosmological puzzle)

    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "G_{\\mu\\nu} + \\Lambda g_{\\mu\\nu} = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}",
    full_explanation: `
## üåå Historical Origin
In 1915, Albert Einstein extended special relativity to include gravity, proposing that **gravity is the curvature of spacetime** caused by mass and energy.

## üìê Conceptual Derivation
Starting from the equivalence principle (gravity ‚âà acceleration), Einstein sought a tensor equation linking geometry ($G_{\\mu\\nu}$) and matter ($T_{\\mu\\nu}$). The Einstein tensor $G_{\\mu\\nu} = R_{\\mu\\nu} - \\frac{1}{2}R g_{\\mu\\nu}$ ensures local conservation ($\\nabla_\\mu T^{\\mu\\nu} = 0$).

The cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ was added (then retracted, then revived) to account for dark energy.

## üß† Key Assumptions
- Strong equivalence principle
- General covariance (laws are identical in all reference frames)
- Spacetime is a smooth 4D manifold

## üí• Implications
- Bending of starlight by the Sun (confirmed in 1919)
- GPS satellites require relativistic time corrections
- Predicts black holes and gravitational waves (detected in 2015)

    statement_latex: "\\text{State: } |\\psi\\rangle \\in \\mathcal{H}, \\quad \\text{Measurement: } P(a) = |\\langle a|\\psi\\rangle|^2",
    full_explanation: `
## ‚öõÔ∏è Historical Origin
Developed between 1925‚Äì1930 by Heisenberg, Schr√∂dinger, Born, Dirac, and von Neumann, quantum mechanics describes a probabilistic, non-local reality.

## üìê Core Postulates
1. A system‚Äôs state is a vector $|\\psi\\rangle$ in a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}$.
2. Observables are Hermitian operators.
3. Measuring observable $A$ yields eigenvalue $a$ with probability $P(a) = |\\langle a|\\psi\\rangle|^2$ (Born rule).
4. After measurement, the state collapses to $|a\\rangle$.

## üß† Key Assumptions
- Unitary, linear time evolution (Schr√∂dinger equation)
- Completeness of the quantum state description

## üí• Implications
- Quantum entanglement (EPR paradox, Bell‚Äôs inequalities)
- Fundamental uncertainty (Heisenberg)
- Enables lasers, transistors, MRI, and quantum computing

  mass_energy: {
    name: "Mass-Energy Equivalence",
    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "E = mc^2",
    full_explanation: `
## üí• Historical Origin
In September 1905, Albert Einstein published a short paper titled *"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?"* as part of special relativity, showing that **mass and energy are interchangeable**.

## üìê Conceptual Derivation
Einstein considered a body at rest emitting two light pulses (photons) of equal energy $\\varepsilon$ in opposite directions. To conserve momentum, the body remains at rest. But in a moving frame, photon energies shift (Doppler effect). Enforcing **energy conservation in all frames** leads to:

$$
\\Delta E = \\Delta m \\cdot c^2
$$

Thus, a loss of energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to a loss of mass $\\Delta m = \\Delta E / c^2$.

## üß† Key Assumptions
- Principle of relativity (laws are identical in all inertial frames)
- Invariance of the speed of light ($c$ is constant)
- Conservation of energy and momentum

## üí• Implications
- Explains energy release in **nuclear reactions** (fission/fusion)
- Foundation of **particle physics** (pair production/annihilation)
- Verified via mass defect in atomic nuclei

> "The mass of a body is a measure of its energy content."  
> ‚Äî Albert Einstein, 1905

  heisenberg: {
    name: "Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle",
    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\frac{\\hbar}{2}",
    full_explanation: `
## üîç Historical Origin
Werner Heisenberg formulated this principle in 1927 while analyzing the limits of simultaneously measuring a particle‚Äôs position and momentum.

## üìê Mathematical Proof
In quantum mechanics, $\\hat{x}$ and $\\hat{p}$ do not commute: $[\\hat{x}, \\hat{p}] = i\\hbar$. For any two non-commuting operators, Robertson‚Äôs inequality gives:

$$
\\sigma_A \\sigma_B \\geq \\frac{1}{2} \\left| \\langle [\\hat{A}, \\hat{B}] \\rangle \\right|
$$

Applied to $x$ and $p$, this yields $\\sigma_x \\sigma_p \\geq \\hbar/2$.

## üß† Interpretation
This is not a technological limitation, but a **fundamental property of nature**: particles do not have definite trajectories.

## üí• Implications
- Atomic stability (electrons don‚Äôt spiral into the nucleus)
- Quantum vacuum fluctuations
- Fundamental limits in microscopy and metrology

    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "\\vec{F} = m\\vec{a} \\quad \\text{(2nd Law)}",
    full_explanation: `
## üèõÔ∏è Historical Origin
Published in 1687 in *Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica*, Newton‚Äôs three laws founded classical mechanics.

## üìê Statements
1. **Inertia**: An object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a force.
2. **Force**: $\\vec{F} = \\frac{d\\vec{p}}{dt} = m\\vec{a}$ (for constant mass).
3. **Action-Reaction**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

## üß† Key Assumptions
- Absolute space and time
- Valid at low speeds ($v \\ll c$) and macroscopic scales (not quantum)

## üí• Implications
- Predicts planetary orbits (combined with universal gravitation)
- Basis of classical engineering
- Superseded by relativity and quantum mechanics at extremes

    statement_latex: "\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, \\mathbf{r}_2) = -\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_2, \\mathbf{r}_1) \\text{ for fermions}",
    full_explanation: `
## ‚öõÔ∏è Historical Origin
Wolfgang Pauli proposed this principle in 1925 to explain atomic structure and the periodic table.

## üìê Formulation
No two fermions (half-integer spin particles, e.g., electrons) can occupy the same quantum state. This follows from the antisymmetry of the total wavefunction:

$$
\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_1, s_1; \\mathbf{r}_2, s_2) = -\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}_2, s_2; \\mathbf{r}_1, s_1)
$$

If two electrons shared all quantum numbers, $\\Psi = -\\Psi \\Rightarrow \\Psi = 0$ (forbidden).

## üß† Implications
- Electron shell structure ‚Üí chemistry
- Degeneracy pressure (white dwarfs, neutron stars)
- Conductivity in metals

  born_rule: {
    name: "Born Rule",
    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "P(x) = |\\psi(x)|^2",
    full_explanation: `
## üé≤ Historical Origin
Max Born proposed in 1926 that the wavefunction $\\psi$ does not represent a physical wave, but a **probability amplitude**.

## üìê Formulation
For a particle in 1D, the probability of finding it between $x$ and $x+dx$ is:

$$
P(x)\\,dx = |\\psi(x)|^2\\,dx
$$

Normalization: $\\int |\\psi(x)|^2\\,dx = 1$.

## üß† Interpretation
This bridges the deterministic evolution of $\\psi$ (via Schr√∂dinger) and the random outcomes of measurements.

## üí• Implications
- Foundation of the Copenhagen interpretation
- Basis of all quantum predictions
- Verified by countless experiments (interference, diffraction)

## üîÅ Historical Origin
Formalized in the 19th century (Mayer, Joule, Helmholtz), this law states that **energy cannot be created or destroyed**, only transformed.

## üìê Theoretical Proof
Noether‚Äôs Theorem (1918): **every continuous symmetry implies a conservation law**. Time-translation symmetry ($\\partial \\mathcal{L}/\\partial t = 0$) ‚áí energy conservation.

## üß† Validity
- Holds in classical, relativistic, and quantum physics
- In an expanding universe, global time symmetry is broken ‚Üí energy is not conserved cosmologically

## üí• Implications
- Perpetual motion machines are impossible
- Energy accounting in chemical/nuclear reactions
- Foundation of thermodynamics and engineering

## üöÄ Historical Origin
Rooted in the work of Descartes and Newton, this law is central to mechanics.

## üìê Theoretical Proof
Noether‚Äôs Theorem: **spatial translation symmetry** ‚áí conservation of total momentum.

## üß† Validity
- Holds in classical, relativistic, and quantum physics
- Even in inelastic collisions, total momentum is conserved

## üí• Applications
- Rocket propulsion (momentum exchange)
- Particle physics (collision analysis)
- Stability of planetary systems

    full_explanation: `
## ‚ö° Historical Origin
James Clerk Maxwell unified electricity and magnetism in 1865, showing that light is an electromagnetic wave.

## üìê The Four Equations (in differential form)
1. Gauss‚Äôs Law: Electric field divergence ‚àù charge density
2. Faraday‚Äôs Law: Changing magnetic field induces electric field
3. Gauss‚Äôs Law for Magnetism: No magnetic monopoles
4. Amp√®re-Maxwell Law: Currents and changing E-fields produce B-fields

## üß† Key Insight
The term $\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0 \\frac{\\partial \\mathbf{E}}{\\partial t}$ (displacement current) was Maxwell‚Äôs addition‚Äîit predicts **self-sustaining EM waves** propagating at speed $c = 1/\\sqrt{\\mu_0\\varepsilon_0}$.

    statement_latex: "c = \\text{constant}, \\quad \\text{Lorentz transformations}",
    full_explanation: `
## üöÑ Historical Origin
Einstein published special relativity in 1905 to resolve contradictions between Maxwell‚Äôs electromagnetism and Newtonian mechanics.

## üìê Postulates
1. **Principle of Relativity**: Laws of physics are identical in all inertial frames.
2. **Invariance of $c$**: The speed of light in vacuum is constant for all observers.

## üìê Key Results
- Time dilation: $\\Delta t = \\gamma \\Delta t_0$
- Length contraction: $L = L_0 / \\gamma$
- Relativistic momentum: $\\vec{p} = \\gamma m \\vec{v}$
- $E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2$

where $\\gamma = 1/\\sqrt{1 - v^2/c^2}$.

## üí• Implications

    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = \\hat{H}\\Psi",
    full_explanation: `
## ‚öõÔ∏è Historical Origin
In 1926, Erwin Schr√∂dinger formulated a wave equation describing how quantum states evolve over time, inspired by de Broglie‚Äôs matter-wave hypothesis.

## üìê Physical Derivation
Start from classical energy:  
$$
E = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(\\mathbf{r})
$$

In quantum mechanics, replace:
- $E \\rightarrow i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$
- $\\mathbf{p} \\rightarrow -i\\hbar \\nabla$

Applying these to a wavefunction $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ yields:

$$
i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)
$$

where $\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V$ is the **Hamiltonian operator**.

## üß† Key Assumptions
- Wavefunction $\\Psi$ fully describes the system
- Evolution is deterministic and unitary

## üí• Implications
- Predicts atomic energy levels (e.g., hydrogen)
- Foundation of quantum chemistry and semiconductor physics
- Probabilistic interpretation via Born rule ($P = |\\Psi|^2$)

    category: "Fundamental Physics",
    statement_latex: "(i\\hbar\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - mc) \\psi = 0",
    full_explanation: `
## üåÄ Historical Origin
Paul Dirac derived this equation in 1928 to reconcile quantum mechanics with special relativity for electrons.

## üìê Motivation and Form
The Schr√∂dinger equation is non-relativistic. The Klein-Gordon equation is relativistic but has negative probabilities. Dirac sought a **first-order** equation in time and space:

$$
(i\\hbar\\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - mc) \\psi = 0
$$

where $\\gamma^\\mu$ are 4√ó4 matrices, and $\\psi$ is a 4-component **spinor**.

## üß† Key Predictions
- Electron spin emerges naturally (not added ad hoc)
- Magnetic moment of the electron
- **Antimatter**: negative-energy solutions ‚Üí prediction of the positron (discovered 1932)

  // üåå COSMOLOGY (4)
  hubble_lemaitre: {
    name: "Hubble-Lema√Ætre Law",
    category: "Cosmology",
    statement_latex: "v = H_0 \\, d",
    full_explanation: `
## üå† Historical Origin
Georges Lema√Ætre (1927) and Edwin Hubble (1929) independently found that **galaxies recede from us**, with velocity proportional to distance.

## üìê Observational Basis
Hubble measured redshifts of galaxies and their distances (via Cepheid variables). The linear relation:

$$
v = H_0 \\, d
$$

where $v$ = recession velocity, $d$ = distance, $H_0$ = Hubble constant (~70 km/s/Mpc).

## üß† Interpretation
This is **not** motion through space, but **expansion of space itself** (metric expansion). Galaxies are carried apart as spacetime stretches.

## üí• Implications
- Evidence for the Big Bang
- Defines the age of the universe: $t \\approx 1/H_0$
- Led to modern cosmology and the ŒõCDM model

    statement_latex: "\\Omega_\\Lambda \\approx 0.69",
    full_explanation: `
## üåå Historical Origin
In 1998, two teams studying distant supernovae discovered that the universe‚Äôs expansion is **accelerating**, not slowing down.

## üìê Evidence
Type Ia supernovae are "standard candles." Their observed brightness was **fainter than expected**, implying greater distance ‚Üí acceleration.

This requires a repulsive component: **dark energy**, modeled as a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$.

## üß† Properties
- Smooth, non-clumping energy filling space
- Negative pressure: $p = -\\rho c^2$
- Constitutes ~69% of the universe‚Äôs energy density ($\\Omega_\\Lambda \\approx 0.69$)

## üí• Implications
- Fate of the universe: "Big Freeze" or "Big Rip"

  cosmological_principle: {
    name: "Cosmological Principle",

    full_explanation: `
## üåç Historical Origin
Assumed since Copernicus, formalized in modern cosmology by Einstein and Friedmann.

## üìê Statement
On sufficiently large scales (>100 Mpc), the universe is:
- **Homogeneous**: same at every point
- **Isotropic**: same in every direction

This is supported by:
- Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) uniformity (1 part in 100,000)
- Galaxy surveys (e.g., SDSS)

## üß† Role in Cosmology
This principle justifies the **Friedmann-Lema√Ætre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric**, the foundation of Big Bang cosmology.

## üí• Caveats
- Not valid at small scales (galaxies, clusters)
- Tensions exist (e.g., "Hubble tension," large-scale structures like the "Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall")

  cosmic_inflation: {
    name: "Cosmic Inflation",
    category: "Cosmology",
    statement_latex: "a(t) \\propto e^{H t}, \\quad H \\approx \\text{constant}",
    full_explanation: `
## üí• Historical Origin
Proposed by Alan Guth (1980) to solve horizon, flatness, and monopole problems in Big Bang cosmology.

## üìê Mechanism
A scalar "inflaton" field dominated the early universe (~$10^{-36}$ s after Big Bang), causing **exponential expansion**:

$$
a(t) \\propto e^{H t}
$$

where $a(t)$ is the scale factor, and $H$ is nearly constant.

## üß† Solved Problems
- **Horizon problem**: Why is CMB so uniform? ‚Üí regions were in causal contact before inflation.
- **Flatness problem**: Why is space so flat? ‚Üí inflation stretched curvature to near zero.
- **Monopole problem**: Why no magnetic monopoles? ‚Üí diluted to undetectable levels.

## üí• Evidence
- CMB fluctuations match inflationary predictions (scale-invariant, Gaussian, adiabatic)
- Observed flatness ($\\Omega_{\\text{total}} \\approx 1$)

> Inflation is not yet directly proven, but it‚Äôs the leading paradigm.

  bekenstein_bound: {
    name: "Bekenstein Bound",
    category: "Information",
    statement_latex: "S \\leq \\frac{2\\pi k_B R E}{\\hbar c}",
    full_explanation: `
## üîê Historical Origin
Jacob Bekenstein (1981) showed that **the entropy (information content) of any finite region of space is bounded** by its surface area, not volume.

## üìê Formula
For a system of energy $E$ and radius $R$:

$$
S \\leq \\frac{2\\pi k_B R E}{\\hbar c}
$$

In natural units ($k_B = \\hbar = c = 1$): $S \\leq 2\\pi R E$.

## üß† Connection to Black Holes
For a black hole, equality holds: $S_{\\text{BH}} = \\frac{k_B A}{4\\ell_P^2}$, where $A$ is horizon area. This led to the **holographic principle**.

## üí• Implications
- Information in a region is encoded on its boundary
- Fundamental limit on data storage (e.g., a 1 cm sphere can store ~$10^{66}$ bits)
- Deep link between gravity, quantum mechanics, and information

  landauer_principle: {
    name: "Landauer's Principle",
    category: "Information",
    statement_latex: "E_{\\text{min}} = k_B T \\ln 2",
    full_explanation: `
## üí° Historical Origin
Rolf Landauer (1961) established a fundamental link between **information theory and thermodynamics**.

## üìê Statement
Erasing **one bit** of information in a computational system at temperature $T$ **must dissipate at least**:

$$
E_{\\text{min}} = k_B T \\ln 2
$$

This is not about measurement, but **irreversible erasure** (e.g., resetting a bit to 0).

## üß† Why?
Erasure reduces phase-space volume, decreasing entropy. To satisfy the Second Law, heat must be dumped into the environment.

## üí• Implications
- Sets ultimate energy limit for computation

    statement_latex: "H(X) = -\\sum_i p(x_i) \\log_2 p(x_i)",
    full_explanation: `
## üì° Historical Origin
Claude Shannon (1948) founded information theory, defining entropy as **average information content** or uncertainty.

## üìê Definition
For a discrete random variable $X$ with outcomes $x_i$ and probabilities $p(x_i)$:

$$
H(X) = -\\sum_i p(x_i) \\log_2 p(x_i)
$$

Units: **bits** (if log base 2).

## üß† Interpretation
- $H = 0$: outcome is certain (no information gained)
- $H = \\log_2 N$: uniform distribution over $N$ outcomes (max uncertainty)
- Measures minimum bits needed to encode messages (source coding theorem)

## üí• Applications
- Data compression (ZIP, MP3, JPEG)
- Cryptography
- Machine learning (decision trees, cross-entropy loss)
- Analogous to thermodynamic entropy (but not identical)

    full_explanation: `
## ü§ñ Historical Origin
Alonzo Church (lambda calculus) and Alan Turing (Turing machines) independently defined computability in 1936. Their models were equivalent.

## üìê Thesis Statement
> "Every effectively calculable function is computable by a Turing machine."

This is a **thesis**, not a theorem‚Äîit cannot be proven, but no counterexample has ever been found.

## üß† Implications
- Defines the **limits of computation**
- All modern computers are Turing-equivalent (same computational power)
- Undecidable problems exist (e.g., Halting Problem)

## üí• Modern View
- Quantum computers are still Turing-computable (they compute the same functions, possibly faster)
- Hypercomputation (beyond Turing) remains speculative

  natural_selection: {
    name: "Natural Selection",
    category: "Biology",
    statement_latex: "\\text{Fitness} \\propto \\text{Reproductive Success}",
    full_explanation: `
## üåø Historical Origin
Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace proposed natural selection in 1858 as the mechanism for evolution.

## üìê Core Logic
1. **Variation**: Individuals in a population differ.
2. **Heritability**: Traits are passed to offspring.
3. **Selection**: Some traits confer higher survival/reproduction ("fitness").
4. **Time**: Advantageous traits accumulate over generations.

Mathematically, fitness $w$ is proportional to expected reproductive success.

## üß† Modern Synthesis
Combined with genetics (1930s‚Äì1950s), natural selection explains:
- Adaptation
- Speciation
- Biodiversity

## üí• Evidence
- Fossil record
- Observed speciation (e.g., Darwin‚Äôs finches)
- Antibiotic resistance in bacteria
- DNA sequence homology

    statement_latex: "P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H) P(H)}{P(E)}",
    full_explanation: `
## üéØ Historical Origin
Thomas Bayes derived this result in the 1750s (published posthumously in 1763). It was later refined by Laplace.

## üìê Formula
Given a hypothesis $H$ and evidence $E$:

$$
P(H|E) = \\frac{P(E|H) \\, P(H)}{P(E)}
$$

- $P(H)$: prior probability (belief before evidence)
- $P(E|H)$: likelihood
- $P(H|E)$: posterior probability (updated belief)

## üß† Interpretation
Bayes‚Äô theorem is the foundation of **probabilistic reasoning** and **learning from data**.

## üí• Applications
- Medical diagnosis (e.g., interpreting test results)
- Machine learning (Naive Bayes, Bayesian networks)
- Spam filtering
- Scientific inference (updating theories with new data)

    name: "G√∂del's Incompleteness Theorems",
    category: "Mathematics",
    statement_latex: "\\text{Any consistent formal system rich enough for arithmetic is incomplete.}",
    full_explanation: `
## üß© Historical Origin
Kurt G√∂del proved these theorems in 1931, shattering Hilbert‚Äôs dream of a complete, consistent foundation for mathematics.

## üìê The Two Theorems
1. **First Incompleteness Theorem**: In any consistent formal system capable of expressing basic arithmetic, there are **true statements that cannot be proven** within the system.
2. **Second Incompleteness Theorem**: Such a system cannot prove its own consistency.

## üß† Key Insight
G√∂del encoded statements about the system **within the system itself** (G√∂del numbering), constructing a self-referential sentence: "This statement is not provable."

## üí• Implications
- Limits of formal reasoning
- No "final" foundation for mathematics
- Influenced computer science (undecidability, halting problem)
- Philosophical impact on truth, proof, and knowledge

  periodic_law: {
    name: "Periodic Law",
    category: "Chemistry",
    statement_latex: "\\text{Properties are periodic functions of atomic number } Z",
    full_explanation: `
## üß™ Historical Origin
Dmitri Mendeleev formulated the periodic law in 1869, arranging elements by atomic weight and noting repeating ("periodic") chemical properties.

## üìê Modern Statement
> "The physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions of their **atomic number** $Z$ (number of protons)."

Mendeleev left gaps for undiscovered elements (e.g., Ga, Ge) and accurately predicted their properties.

## üß† Quantum Explanation
Electron shell structure (from Schr√∂dinger equation) explains periodicity:
- Elements in the same group have same valence electron configuration
- Periods correspond to filling of electron shells (s, p, d, f)

## üí• Implications
- Predicts reactivity, bonding, ionization energy, etc.
- Organizes all known elements (118+)
- Foundation of modern chemistry and materials science

        category: "Fundamental Physics",
        statement_latex: "E = mc^2",
        full_explanation: `
## üß™ Historical Origin
In September 1905, Albert Einstein published a short paper titled *"Does the Inertia of a Body Depend Upon Its Energy Content?"* as part of his special theory of relativity. He demonstrated that **mass and energy are interchangeable**.

## üìê Conceptual Derivation
Einstein considered a body at rest emitting two light pulses (photons) of equal energy $\\varepsilon$ in opposite directions. To conserve total momentum, the body remains at rest. However, in a moving reference frame, the photon energies change (Doppler effect). By enforcing **energy conservation in all inertial frames**, he obtained:

$$
\\Delta E = \\Delta m \\cdot c^2
$$

This means a loss of energy $\\Delta E$ corresponds to a loss of mass $\\Delta m = \\Delta E / c^2$.

## üß† Fundamental Assumptions
- Principle of relativity (physical laws are identical in all inertial frames)
- Invariance of the speed of light ($c$ is constant)
- Conservation of energy and momentum

## üí• Major Consequences
- Explains energy release in **nuclear reactions** (fission and fusion)
- Foundation of **particle physics** (pair creation/annihilation)
- Experimentally verified via **mass defect** in atomic nuclei

        category: "Fundamental Physics",
        statement_latex: "i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi = \\hat{H}\\Psi",
        full_explanation: `
## üß™ Historical Origin
In 1926, Erwin Schr√∂dinger formulated a wave equation describing how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time. Inspired by de Broglie‚Äôs wave-particle duality, he initially sought a **relativistic wave equation**, but began with the non-relativistic case.

## üìê Physical Derivation
Start from the classical energy of a particle:  
$$
E = \\frac{p^2}{2m} + V(\\mathbf{r})
$$

In quantum mechanics, we replace:
- $E \\rightarrow i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$
- $\\mathbf{p} \\rightarrow -i\\hbar \\nabla$

Applying these operators to a wavefunction $\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ yields:

$$
i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t) = \\left[ -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right] \\Psi(\\mathbf{r},t)
$$

where $\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\nabla^2 + V$ is the **Hamiltonian operator**.

## üß† Key Assumptions
- The wavefunction $\\Psi$ contains all information about the system
- Time evolution is **deterministic** and **unitary**
- Observables are represented by Hermitian operators

## üî¨ Consequences
- Enables calculation of atomic energy levels (e.g., hydrogen)
- Foundation of quantum chemistry, semiconductors, and quantum computing
- Probabilistic interpretation via the Born rule ($P = |\\Psi|^2$)
