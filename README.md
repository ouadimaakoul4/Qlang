QLang â€” Library of Universal Laws
QLang is an open-source web application that provides an interactive library of fundamental universal laws across physics, cosmology, information theory, biology, chemistry, and mathematics. Users can query laws, explore the full library, view random laws, and download the dataset for offline use.
Features

Interactive Query System: Ask questions about universal laws and receive synthesized responses based on keyword and phrase matching.
LaTeX Formula Rendering: Mathematical formulations are displayed using MathJax for clarity.
Library View: Browse all laws, filter by category, and sort by name, confidence, or discovery date.
Random Law Display: Discover a random law with detailed information.
Query History: Revisit past questions stored in local storage.
Downloadable Data: Export the laws as a JSON file for analysis or offline use.
Accessible Design: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast visuals for inclusivity.

Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://ouadimaakoul4.github.io/Qlang


Serve the Application:

Use a local server (e.g., python -m http.server or VS Code Live Server) to serve index.html and laws.json.
Ensure an internet connection for CDN dependencies (MathJax, marked.js).


Dependencies:

No local installations required; all dependencies are loaded via CDN:
marked.js
MathJax
Polyfill
